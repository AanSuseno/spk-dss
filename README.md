# DSS Collection

Welcome to our Decision Support System (DSS) web application, powered by CodeIgniter 4. This robust and user-friendly platform is designed to assist users in making informed decisions across various domains. Our application integrates cutting-edge features to streamline decision-making processes.

## What is CodeIgniter?

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework that is light, fast, flexible and secure.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://codeigniter.com).

This repository holds a composer-installable app starter.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

More information about the plans for version 4 can be found in [CodeIgniter 4](https://forum.codeigniter.com/forumdisplay.php?fid=28) on the forums.

The user guide corresponding to the latest version of the framework can be found
[here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/).

## Installation & updates

`composer create-project codeigniter4/appstarter` then `composer update` whenever
there is a new release of the framework.

When updating, check the release notes to see if there are any changes you might need to apply
to your `app` folder. The affected files can be copied or merged from
`vendor/codeigniter4/framework/app`.

## Setup

Copy `env` to `.env` and tailor for your app, specifically the baseURL
and any database settings.
Don't forget to import the database.
